notes = "Sample die holder - features need to be defined via DXF editor"

# Features need to be picked from the DXF geometry.
# For a die holder (lower position):
# - mount_ram: bed interface (bottom, angle 270° pointing down)
# - mount_shoulder: slot opening (top, angle 90° pointing up)
# - mount_tongue: slot ceiling (inside slot, angle 90° pointing up)
#
# Current geometry bounds:
#   Bottom (bed): Y = -29.53 mm
#   Top (slot opening): Y = 45.40 mm
#
# Use the DXF editor to pick exact feature positions from the profile.
