# 304 Stainless Steel - Austenitic stainless steel
#
# Stainless steel has significantly higher springback than mild steel
# due to higher yield strength and work hardening characteristics.
#
# These values are typical for air bending with standard V-die ratios (8-12).
# 304SS work hardens during forming, so springback increases with:
# - Sharper bend radii
# - Multiple forming operations
# - Cold working history
#
# For critical applications, calibrate against test bends.
